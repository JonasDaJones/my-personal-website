        Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to
        meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but
        I ain't done much healing...</cite

      <cite>Hello, can you hear me? </cite>
      <p>Well no, Adele is not really my cup of tea.</p>
      <p>
        tbh my cup of tea is not really my cup of tea. But I have to reduce my
        coffee consumption somehow. Anyway, I hope to become a good Web Dev even
        with less caffeine.

        Ever since I learned HTML at the coding bootcamp at
        <a href="https://www.neuefische.de/">neuefische</a> , I've been floating
        through the world of the web with wide eyes, like a kid in a candy
        store. The possibilities seem endless, and every new website I come
        across fills me with wonder and excitement. It's amazing to think that
        with just a few lines of code, I can create something that can be
        accessed by people all over the world. I feel like I've discovered a
        whole new world, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next.
