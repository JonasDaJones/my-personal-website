        <p>
          In my relentless pursuit of the ideal it - solutions for planning,
          management, communication, and presentation, I found myself repeatedly
          compromising. My initial experiences with MS PowerApps ignited my
          curiosity and enthusiasm: It revealed the possibility of adapting
          applications to suit my needs. Yet, there had to be a way to improve
          further. Instead of piecing together a medley of different apps, I
          aimed to be able to offer tailored solutions. And so, I embarked on
          mastering the craft behind this magical sorcery: coding.

          Ever since I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript at the coding bootcamp
          at
          <a href="https://www.neuefische.de/">neuefische</a> , I've been
          floating through the world of the web with wide eyes, like a kid in a
          candy store. The possibilities seem endless, and every new website I
          come across fills me with wonder and excitement. It's amazing to think
          that with just a few lines of code, I can create something that can be
          accessed by people all over the world. I feel like I've discovered a
          whole new world, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next.
